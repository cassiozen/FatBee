### FatBee is a low-profile mechanical keyboard that mixes a familiar layout with scientifically proven ergonomic principles.


## What?

The keyboard design we use today is a relic from the 1800s, created to overcome mechanical limitations, not for comfort - And while ergonomic keyboards exist, they are often intimidating for new users.

But they don't have to: Research shows that combining multiple ergonomic features ‚Äî even in small doses ‚Äî is more effective than going extreme on any single one. FatBee takes this balanced approach: subtle improvements across the board that add up to real comfort while keeping a familiar look and feel, **approachable by users with varying typing techniques (or no typing technique at all.)**

## What's in this repo?

- 3D-print case & palm rest source
- PCB source (KiCad)
- Keyboard layout (standard keyboard-layout-editor.com JSON)
- ZMK profile (coming soon)

## FatBee's Characteristics

- Gently split layout for a natural typing position<br>
  **Why it matters:** Reduces ulnar deviation, a common cause of wrist strain.

- Moderate tenting to avoid forearm pronation<br>
  **Why it matters:** Keeps your forearm bones from squeezing the carpal tunnel.

- Integrated palm rest and low back angle<br>
  **Why it matters:** Prevents wrist extension that can restrict circulation and cause fatigue.

- Centralized alphanumerics<br>
  **Why it matters:** Proper keyboard alignment with your body reduces unnecessary reaching and twisting, which can contribute to shoulder and upper back strain.

## Mini control center

Splitting the keys at an angle while keeping them familiar-looking required a few tricks:

- Centralizing the alphas
- Adding the signature "fat" B key
- A shorter stagger between the rows R2-R3

These design decisions led to some happy accidents, like the unusual space on the left side that ended up becoming a mini control center, complete with:

- An escape key directly aligned with the numeric row<br>
 (I love compact layouts, but having "~", and "'" readily accessible instead of a separate layer is üíØ)
- The function key, followed by three buttons that pair with it, creates a convenient "control center"<br>
 Volume control (Tap to increase, Fn+tap to decrease), Brightness (same principle), and App cycling (Mimics CMD+Tab and CMD+Shift+Tab).
 

## Prior art

- Apple keyboards - I know this sounds weird, given that Apple doesn't make ergonomic keyboards nowadays, but what they have been doing since the 90s is slowly reducing the stagger between rows R2 and R3. Could it be just for aesthetics? Sure, still, it does pave the way...
- Jones keyboard layout ([GitHub](https://github.com/jpskenn/Jones)) - Combines centralized alphanumerics with non-staggered rows R2-R3.
- Logitech Wave keys ([Logitech.com](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/wave-keys.html)) - Despite feeling mushy and cheap, it does deliver great ergonomic improvements while still looking familiar.
