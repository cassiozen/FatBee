## A familiar keyboard with unfamiliar comfort

**Fat Bee** is a compact mechanical keyboard that takes a gentle, scientific approach to ergonomics without making you relearn how to type.

## What?

The keyboard layout we use today is ancient. Literally. It was designed in the 1800s to keep typewriters from jamming — not to keep your wrists from hurting.

Modern ergonomic keyboards try to fix that, but many go too far. Curved key wells, columnar layouts, and deep splits can help *if* you’re willing to adapt. Most people aren't.

**Fat Bee bridges the gap between comfort and familiarity.**
It's the kind of keyboard you can sit down at and just start using — whether you hunt and peck, type with two fingers, or mastered touch typing in high school.

## FatBee's Characteristics

### 👐 Gently split layout  

Just enough angle to align your hands naturally.  
**Reduces ulnar deviation** — that awkward wrist bend that causes strain over time.

### 🏕️ 5.5° tenting

Raises the inner edge of the keyboard to match your forearm's natural rotation.  
**Avoids pronation**, keeps your forearm bones from squeezing the carpal tunnel.

### 🛏️ Built-in palm rest + low rear angle

Supports your hands without forcing your wrists to bend upward.  
**Prevents wrist extension**, a common source of fatigue.

### 🧲 Centralized alphas

Alphanumerics are dead center, not off to the left side.  
**Keeps your arms and shoulders aligned** with your body.

## The control cluster you didn’t know you needed

While redesigning the layout, something unexpected happened.

By centering the keys and adjusting row spacing, we created a weird little negative space on the left. Instead of ignoring it, we filled it with function:

- **Escape**, aligned with the numeric row
  (no layer gymnastics for `~` and `'`)
- **Fn key + 3 utility buttons**:
  - Volume up (tap), volume down (Fn+tap)  
  - Brightness up/down  
  - App switcher (like Cmd+Tab / Shift+Cmd+Tab)

## Specs

- 69 keys, number row, arrow cluster
- Low-profile Choc switches

## Inspiration

- **Apple keyboards** – Subtly decreasing row stagger (between rows R2 and R3) since forever. Probably for style. Still, it adds up - used on FatBee.  
- **[Jones layout](https://github.com/jpskenn/Jones)** – Combines centralized alphanumerics with non-staggered rows R2-R3.
- **[Logitech Wave](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/wave-keys.html)** - Despite feeling mushy and cheap, it does deliver great ergonomic improvements while still looking familiar.
