# PCB

These are KiCad source for FatBee's PCB. Is uses a virtual row/columns and connects to a Nice!nano or compatible microcontroller board.

The PCB is supposed to be bended to accomodate for the 3 different tenting angles: It has a cutting pattern on the middle to facilitate bending, and should be manufactured with 0.6mm thickness.

## Warning

Still under development, use at your own risk. I just ordered this version from JLCPCB and if it works I'll be glad to remove this warning ;)

## What's up with all those screws?

There are three constraints:

- Make it bend
- Make it sturdy enough for hotswap to work
- Make is out of common materials (so one can use services like PCBWay or JLCPCB...)

Possible Solutions:

- Sturdy + Common materials: Well, the default materials aready are sturdy enougn...
- Bend + Sturdy: Hybrid PCV (semi-flex with hardened areas)
- Bend + Common materials: Standard PCB material, but make it thin...
- Bend + Sturdy + Common materials...

I don't know... Have you tried putting a lot of screws?
